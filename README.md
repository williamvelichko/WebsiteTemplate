# WebsiteTemplate

This is a template for creating Conference or Camp websites. Itâ€™s built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this template repository to get started with your own website:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/WebsiteTemplate.git
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd WebsiteTemplate
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
3. Add an Environment File
Create a .env.local file in the root of the project to configure any necessary environment variables. For example, you can add a PAYMENT_LINK variable like so:

plaintext
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_LINK=https://your-payment-link.com
This will allow you to specify the payment link that users can access from the site.

4. Run the Development Server
Start the development server to see your site live on your local machine:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Then, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the result.

You can start editing the site by modifying the files in the app directory. The site will automatically update as you make changes.
